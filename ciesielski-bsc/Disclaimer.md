With this project including another bachelor thesis' code base as well as its own, here is the distribution of code ownership:

Mateusz Ciesielski:
Every file inside of './res/', './src/', and outside of the three top-level folders is written or included by Mateusz Ciesielski as part of his "A reimplementation of the molecular modelling and visualization application BALLView using Julia and Electron" bachelor thesis.

Pascal Pfannes:
Every file inside of './dep/pfannes_bsc/' is either entirely written by Pascal Pfannes as part of his "Visualization of biological molecules in web browsers via three.js" bachelor thesis or only partly changed by Mateusz Ciesielski for project integration or extensibility purposes, with all changes contained in marked places of the './dep/pfannes_bsc/src/MoleculeVisualizer/index.html', './dep/pfannes_bsc/src/MoleculeVisualizer/js/main.js', and './dep/pfannes_bsc/src/MoleculeVisualizer/js/Visualizer.js' files.
